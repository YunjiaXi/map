# Map
Data structure 2018 course work

Maps are associative containers that store elements formed by a combination of a key value and a mapped value, following a specific order.

## Requirements
* the same operations in C++ STL
* use iterator
* no memory leaking
* need to optimize time complexity for test

## Realization
* Red Black Tree (finished)
  * complex and hard to write
  * run faster
* Balanced Binary Tree(not finished)
  * easy to write
  * run slower
